# Project Planning Issue

I encountered an issue with the repository used for coding my project. Initially, I did not utilize the classroom GitHub repository, which resulted in my project being structured differently. As a consequence, I am unable to link it properly to the designated repository.

However, the plan and roadmap of the project are available in one of my public repositories. You can access it through the following link: https://github.com/users/shiwa4656/projects/10/views/4
